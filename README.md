# XML Document Reordering Based on Bounding Boxes

This repository contains Python scripts to reorder items in an XML document based on their bounding boxes. It helps clean up OCR or digital text extraction output (e.g., from Tesseract) and arranges the items in a human-readable order, even in noisy layouts (e.g., multiple columns, images, tilted text).

## Scripts

### `drawBoundingBoxes.py`
Visualizes the bounding boxes for items in an XML file by drawing them on an image. Useful for testing and inspection.

### `OrderDir.py`
Reorders all XML files in a directory and saves the reordered files to another directory.

### `ReOrder.py`
Contains the core logic to reorder XML items based on their bounding box coordinates (`x0`, `x1`, `y0`, `y1`).

## Example XML Format

Your XML should have the following format for proper processing:

```xml
<page>
    <item x0="0" x1="100" y0="0" y1="50">Text from the top-left box</item>
    <item x0="0" x1="100" y0="51" y1="100">Text from the second box</item>
    <item x0="101" x1="200" y0="0" y1="50">Text from the top-right box</item>
    <item x0="101" x1="200" y0="51" y1="100">Text from the second box on the right</item>
</page>
